NSSL Package for building MRMS from a source checkout

This interactive script will help you build a fresh checkout
you can use to code MRMS.

After building a set of SVN/environments settings will be given,
you will have to source those/add to your environment to run
or run svn commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------
INSTRUCTIONS: (These will change as script is developed and 
built further)

Type "./build.py" in this directory

First, build a third party folder..use one of the defaults or
type a folder like /mybuild

Second, if the third party builds fully, rerun the script and
choose the 'build over third' option. Use the same folder name
as when building the third party.  
This will then check out and build the code
